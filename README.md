## Description
The purpose of this site is to give users a place where they are able to find detailed information about a Star Wars character so that they can make a costume based off of that person and their features. The APIs that we chose to use were the SWAPI (Star Wars API) and Youtube. We chose these because we felt they were the best for helping users find information on these characters. A challenge we faced was finding if the Youtube API would work, but in the end we got it figured out!
