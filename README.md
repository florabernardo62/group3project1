## Description
The purpose of this site is to give users a place where they are able to find detailed information about a Star Wars character so that they can make a costume based off of that person and their features. The APIs that we chose to use were the SWAPI (Star Wars API) and Youtube. We chose these because we felt they were the best for helping users find information on these characters. A challenge we faced was finding if the Youtube API would work, but in the end we got it figured out!

As well as information on the characters, users will also be presented with Youtube video links relating to the character they have clicked on.

By default the site is built with a light theme. The 'Faction' button allows you to select the theme for the side. Selecting 'Dark Side' will change the site styling to a dark theme, and the 'Light Side' button will change the site styling to a light theme.
