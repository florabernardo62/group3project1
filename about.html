    <P class="aboutTxt">Welcome to the Star Wars Cosplay Database! Using the Star Wars (SWAPI) API, 
        we provide you with detailed information about each of the nine characters displayed on the 
        home page so you can effectively create the best (and most realistic) costume for that character!
        Whether it be a Halloween party or a cosplay convention, our database will help make sure your costume shines! 
        Simply click the image of the character you would like more information about and see their description
        appear at the bottom of the page along with links to Youtube to see videos relating to that character and inspiration for what the costume could look like.
