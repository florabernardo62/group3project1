			Welcome to the Star Wars Cosplay Database! Using the Star Wars (SWAPI) API, we provide you with detailed
			information about each of the ten characters displayed on the home page so you can effectively create
			the best (and most realistic) costume for that character! Simply click the image of the character you
			would like more information about and see their description appear at the bottom of the page along with
			links to Youtube to see videos relating to that character and inspiration for what the costume could
			look like. You can also visit the contact page to see links to the GitHub accounts of the creators for
			this database! <br /><br />Have fun and may the force be with you!
